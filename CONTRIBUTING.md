- Docker (for local development)

### Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/political-sphere.git
   cd political-sphere
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration

5. **Run tests** to verify setup:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

For detailed onboarding instructions, see [docs/onboarding.md](../docs/onboarding.md).

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Write/update tests
4. Run quality checks:
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   npm run type-check
   npm test
   ```
5. Commit with descriptive messages
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`npm test`)
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with your changes
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive

### PR Guidelines

1. **Use the PR template** - Select appropriate template when creating PR
2. **Keep PRs focused** - One feature/fix per PR
3. **Respect change budgets**:
   - Safe mode: ≤300 lines changed, ≤12 files
   - Fast-secure: ≤200 lines changed, ≤8 files
4. **Link related issues** - Reference issues in PR description
5. **Request review** - Tag appropriate reviewers

### PR Review Process

- PRs require at least one approval from the core team
- All CI checks must pass
- Address reviewer feedback promptly
- Keep the PR up to date with `main`

## Coding Standards

### File Organization

Follow the structure in [.github/copilot-instructions/organization.md](.github/copilot-instructions/organization.md):

```
/apps     - Applications
/libs     - Shared libraries
/tools    - Build tools
/docs     - Documentation
/scripts  - Automation scripts
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files/directories**: `kebab-case`
- **Classes/Components**: `PascalCase`
- **Functions/variables**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

### Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier (configured in project)
- Run `npm run lint:fix` before committing
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Write self-documenting code with clear names

### TypeScript

- Enable strict mode
- Avoid `any` types
- Provide proper type annotations
- Document complex types

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- All new features must have tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests

### Test Types

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/components
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E tests**: Test critical user flows

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage report
npm run test:e2e           # E2E tests only
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Use JSDoc/TSDoc comments
- Explain _why_, not just _what_
- Include examples for complex features

### Project Documentation
