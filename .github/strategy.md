# Strategic & Lifecycle Governance

### Roadmap Alignment

Connect changes to strategy:

- Verify alignment with project roadmap
- Incorporate stakeholder input
- Conduct ethics reviews for sensitive features
- Use transparent prioritization
- Document strategic decisions in ADRs

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Document significant technical choices:

- **Location** → `/docs/architecture/decisions/`
- **Format** → Context, decision, consequences, alternatives considered
- **When** → Technology choices, architectural patterns, critical trade-offs

**Create ADR for:**

- Introducing new dependencies
- Changing system architecture
- Adopting new patterns/practices
- Security/privacy design choices

### Deprecation Policy

Sunset features responsibly:

1. **Announce** → 90 days advance notice minimum
2. **Migrate** → Provide clear migration paths
3. **Support** → Help users transition
4. **Sunset** → Remove with clear timeline
5. **Clean up** → Eliminate technical debt

### Risk Management

Proactively manage risks:

- **Risk Register** → Centralized tracking
- **Risk Owners** → Assigned accountability
- **Mitigations** → Documented strategies
- **Reviews** → Quarterly assessments
- **Escalation** → High-severity risks to leadership

### Mission Alignment

Serve democratic goals:

- Define KPIs/OKRs linked to mission outcomes
- Assess unintended consequences
- Monitor for mission drift
- Ensure features advance democratic engagement
- Conduct regular impact assessments

### Continuous Maturity

Always improve:

- Learn from incidents, failures, and successes
- Adopt industry best practices
- Refresh standards quarterly
- Invest in technical excellence
- Foster culture of learning and experimentation
